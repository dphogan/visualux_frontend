Visualux is the online event visualization portal used by the LUX collaboration, a particle physics experiment seeking to directly detect dark matter.  With this web application, collaborators can interactively explore the measurements made by each sensor, along with overlaid analysis quantities, for over 2 billion events from LUX Runs 3 and 4.

Visualux was developed by Daniel Hogan based on ideas from Carlos Faham, with contributions from Douglas Tiedt.

While the Visualux backend code cannot be posted at this time, this repo contains the frontend website, which uses HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and the JavaScript libraries jQuery, D3, keypress, and FileSaver.  Communication with the backend is handled through the NERSC NEWT utility.

A publicly-accessible demo version of Visualux is available at: https://dphogan.net/visualux
